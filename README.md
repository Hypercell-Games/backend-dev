SuperStore Backend API Adventure
===============================

This repository contains base project for SuperStore Backend.
SuperStore Backend project is used as a starter pack for live coding session.

## Tech stack

This backend is built using:

- TypeScript
- NestJS
- Drizzle ORM

Additionally, it uses:

- Docker compose for local development
- Drizzle Kit migration scripts to prepare database schema
- ESlint and Prettier for code formatting
- Source Map Support to ensure proper stack traces in development
- Redis for data caching

## Prerequisites

To perform live coding session tasks it's expected to additionally have knowledge of:

- Running docker containers with docker-compose
- Using Drizzle ORM to structure and perform queries

If you're not familiar with any of these technologies, don't worry :)
You still have time to get basic understanding of them before the session.
It's not that hard, we promise.

## Getting Started

Please perform following steps before live coding session:

- Clone this repository
- Get familiar with the codebase
- Ensure docker-compose is starting and running correctly
- Run `drizzle:migrate` npm script to prepare database schema
- Pick your favorite Redis library and add it to the project
- Check if the application is running correctly (perform `GET /customers` or `GET /products`)

## Live Coding Session

During the live coding session you will be working on various tasks and features.
All the tasks will be described in detail during the intro phase of the session.

Feel free to use any IDE, code assistant or search engine to help you.

Good luck and have fun!
